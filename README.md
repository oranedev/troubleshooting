### **Mac Troubleshooting Examples:**

1. **Hardware:** 
    - A Macbook doesn't power on. You perform an SMC (System Management Controller) reset by pressing and holding down the power button for 10 seconds, then release the button and try to turn the laptop on again.
    - How to know if you need to reset the SMC:
These symptoms might mean that an SMC reset is necessary:

Your computer’s fans run at high speed, even though it isn’t under heavy usage and is properly ventilated.
The keyboard backlight behaves incorrectly.
The status indicator light, if present, behaves incorrectly.
Battery indicator lights, if present, behave incorrectly on Mac notebooks with a non-removable battery.
Your Mac doesn’t respond when you press the power button.
Your Mac notebook doesn’t respond properly when you close or open the lid.
The battery doesn’t charge properly.
Your Mac sleeps or shuts down unexpectedly and you can’t turn it back on.
The display backlight doesn’t respond correctly to ambient light changes.
Your MacBook or MacBook Pro doesn’t charge through its built-in USB-C port.
Your MacBook or MacBook Pro doesn’t recognise external devices that are connected to its built-in USB-C port.
The MagSafe power adapter LED, if present, doesn’t indicate the correct charging activity.
Your Mac performs unusually slowly, even though its CPU isn’t under an abnormally heavy load.
A Mac that supports target display mode doesn’t switch into or out of target display mode as expected, or it switches into or out of target display mode at unexpected times.
The illumination around the I/O ports on a Mac Pro (Late 2013) doesn’t turn on when you move the computer.
  


### **PC Troubleshooting Examples:**

1. **Hardware:** 
    - A desktop PC doesn't power up. You check the power source, test with a different power cable, and also ensure the power supply unit (PSU) of the computer isn't faulty.

2. **Software:** 
    - A user's Windows PC frequently displays the "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD). You check the error code on the BSOD to identify the issue and find out it's a driver problem. You then update the problematic driver.

3. **Hardware:** 
    - A laptop's keyboard isn't working. You connect an external keyboard to check if it's a hardware or software issue. If the external keyboard works, it's likely a hardware problem with the laptop's built-in keyboard.
  
4. **Software:** 
    - A user can't connect to the internet on their Windows laptop. You go to "Network and Sharing Center" to diagnose and troubleshoot the network issue, which turns out to be a misconfigured IP setting.
